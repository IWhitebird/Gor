title: Hello World
description: Write your first Gor program.
---

Create a file called `hello.gor`:

```js title="hello.gor"
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run it:

```bash
./bin/gor hello.gor
```

Or try it directly in the [Playground](/playground).

## A Bigger Example

```js title="example.gor"
# Variables
let name = "Gor"
const version = 1

print("Welcome to " + name)

# Functions
fn add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

print(add(40, 2))
```
