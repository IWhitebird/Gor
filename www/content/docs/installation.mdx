Gor requires **Go 1.22+** to build. Clone the repository and build with Make:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IWhitebird/Gor.git
cd Gor
make build
```

This produces the `bin/gor` binary. You can run files, start the REPL, or inspect the AST:

```bash
./bin/gor file.gor          # Run a source file
./bin/gor --repl            # Interactive REPL
./bin/gor --ast file.gor    # Print AST as JSON
./bin/gor --version         # Print version
```

Or build manually without Make:

```bash
go build -o bin/gor ./cmd/gor/
```
