description: Working with ordered, zero-indexed arrays.

Arrays are ordered, zero-indexed collections:

```js
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Access by index
print(arr[0])    # 10
print(arr[4])    # 50

# Modify by index
arr[2] = 99
print(arr[2])    # 99

# Arrays can hold mixed types
let mixed = [1, "hello", true, null]
```

<Callout type="warn">
Accessing an out-of-bounds index will cause a runtime error.
</Callout>
