description: Declaring functions, closures, and higher-order functions.

Declare functions with `fn`:

```js
fn add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

print(add(3, 4))   # 7
```

## Closures

Functions are first-class values. They capture their lexical scope, forming closures:

```js
fn makeCounter(start) {
    let count = start
    fn increment() {
        count = count + 1
        return count
    }
    return increment
}

let counter = makeCounter(0)
print(counter())   # 1
print(counter())   # 2
print(counter())   # 3
```

Each call to `makeCounter` creates a new closure with its own `count` variable. The inner function `increment` captures and modifies the outer variable.

## Higher-Order Functions

Functions can be passed as arguments and returned from other functions:

```js
fn makeAdder(x) {
    fn add(y) {
        return x + y
    }
    return add
}

let add10 = makeAdder(10)
print(add10(5))    # 15
print(add10(20))   # 30
```
