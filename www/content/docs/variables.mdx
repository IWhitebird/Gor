title: Variables
description: Declaring and using variables with let and const.
---

Declare variables with `let` (mutable) or `const` (immutable):

```js
let x = 10
let name = "Gor"
const PI = 3

# let can be reassigned
x = 20

# const cannot be reassigned — this would error:
# PI = 4
```

Variables declared with `let` can optionally omit the initializer (defaults to `null`):

```js
let y
print(y)   # null
```

Variables declared with `const` must have an initializer.
