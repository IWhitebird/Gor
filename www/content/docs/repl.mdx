description: Using the Gor interactive REPL.
---

Start the interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop:

```bash
./bin/gor --repl
```

Type Gor expressions and see results immediately. The REPL maintains state between lines, so variables and functions persist within a session.

## Example Session

```
$ ./bin/gor --repl
Gor REPL
> let x = 10
> print(x + 5)
15
> fn double(n) { return n * 2 }
> print(double(x))
20
```
